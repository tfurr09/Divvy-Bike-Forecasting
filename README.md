# Divvy-Bike-Forecasting

This was a 2 part project. The first part was done in my data engineering class and the second in my time series class, both at the University of Chicago. To see a thorough writeup of the project on my website, go [here](https://taylorfurry.com/2024/01/03/divvy-bike-engineering-and-forecasting/)

The purpose behind this project was to understand data engineering techniques as well as create time series models to forecast demand. The data comes from Divvy, a bike service in Chicago. We analyzed the number of rides over given periods of time. Parts of the project were done in Python, R, MySQL and Tableau. The real data can be found at the Divvy website.
